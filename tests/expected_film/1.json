Producer Deeley pursued De Niro for The Deer Hunter because he felt that he needed De Niro's star power to sell a film with a \"gruesome-sounding storyline and a barely known director\". \"I liked the script, and  had done a lot of prep,\" said De Niro. \"I was impressed.\" De Niro prepared by socializing with steelworkers in local bars and by visiting their homes. Cimino introduced De Niro as his agent, Harry Ufland. No one recognized him. De Niro claims this was his most physically exhausting film. He explained that the scene where Mike visits Steven in the hospital for the first time was the most emotional scene that he was ever involved with. For the film, he received his first one-million-dollar fee. De Niro was a last-minute replacement for Roy Scheider, who dropped out of the production two weeks before the start of filming due to \"creative differences\"; Universal managed to keep Scheider to his three-picture contract by forcing him to do Jaws 2 (1978)."}, {"detail": "Christopher Walken", "notes": ["\"Nick\""], "role": "Corporal Nikanor Chevotarevich.
